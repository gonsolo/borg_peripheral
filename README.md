# TinyQV-GPU

## Working

* Integer addition in Chisel
* Test integer addition
# Generated docs for Tinytapeout

## TODO

* Floating point addition in Chisel plus test
* Floating point multiplication in Chisel plus test
* Tinytapeout test
* Tinytapeout gds

## TODO later

* Pull request for ttsky25a-tinyQV
* Test there
* When pico-ice arrives: FPGA testing
* Generate GDS
* Submit for next shuttle

~~Right now, it's just a floating point adder wired up to the example project.
With a 1x2 tile configuration, utilization is 39.9%.~~
