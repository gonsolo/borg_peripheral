# TinyQV-GPU - Tinytapeout Floating Point Test

## Working

* Chisel integer addition
* Mill test
* TT test locally and Github
* TT docs locally and Github
* TT gds Githb

## TODO

* TT gds locally
* Chisel floating point addition + test
* Chisel floating point multiplication + test

## TODO later

* Pull request for ttsky25a-tinyQV
* Test there
* When pico-ice arrives: FPGA testing
* Submit for next shuttle

~~Right now, it's just a floating point adder wired up to the example project.
With a 1x2 tile configuration, utilization is 39.9%.~~
